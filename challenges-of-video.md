# Nine Challenges of Video Distribution and Why They're Not Really a Challenge

You are a self-declared foodie, and you've always tremendously enjoyed cooking. What's more, you love hearing from your friends about the different dishes they like to cook, and the specific nuances that add flair to those dishes. You wish everyone had this opportunity to share food-related thoughts and ideas, so you create a platform for people to share the recipes closest to their heart. Classic, right? But to make things interesting, you decide to replace the usual final-product photo with a short video featuring the crucial parts of the cooking process. 

So you start looking into video options for your platform and discover that, if you want to do things right, there are going to be a lot of complicated steps involved. 

## 1. Ingestion  

For starters, each culinary expert, which is the cheesy name you've given the users of your platform, needs to have the ability to upload their videos, be it from their desktop or mobile phone. They need to be able to upload any format and any size of video. 

## 2. Editing 

What if the user wants to do some basic editing on their video? Shortening it maybe, to fit the ninety seconds you've recommended? Or perhaps they want to break it into small clips for each relevant clip. So they'll need the ability to do that kind of post-production and add new videos to their collection of videos. 

## 3. Transcoding 

You probably haven't considered the whole world of transcoding. Maybe you've heard it referred to as encoding? Either way, it is the process in which video files are converted into different file formats, to make them available for viewing on different types of devices. Your 55 inch TV doesn't play the same video you'd watch on your phone - you can imagine how grainy that would look on your TV, or how long it would take to load on your phone. These videos are transcoded using "codecs", which are like algorithms that determine how the files will be compressed and optimized quality and bandwidth consumption, a process that requires a whole lot of server resources. Add that to the list of thigns you'll need: a bunch of really strong processors that'll convert each uploaded video to a bunch of different formats resolutions and qualities.

## 4. Thumbnails (aka Poster)

Have you ever uploaded a video of yourself to YouTube, and when it was finally ready to watch, you notiecd that the thumbnail for the video is a really unflattering shot of you? Well, you really don't want that to happent to your Culinary Experts; their video thumbnail is essentially what's going to attract viewers to that specific post, so you need to give them the ability to select the best frame in their video in order to display in their recipe gallery, or even more importantly, on social media. There's an option to upload an edited picture that is not grabbed from the video. 

## 5. Captioning 

There's also the whole world of captions and subtitles, which is important if viewers in different countries, or with disabilities, who wants to watch, and especially useful when the experts are talking about ingredients that not everyone is familiar with. And providing caption abilities is not only useful during video playback - it can also be added to the metadata available for that specific video, and to be narrated by screen-readers.

## 6. Search 

...Bringing us to the world of searching. You want the end users to serch for a word or ingredient and find everything that coul be relevant. You want synonyms and partial matches. You want categories, hastags... You want results that include matches not only from title and descriptions, but also from words that were voiced by the culinary experts in their video recordings. You need really really good search capabilities. 

## 7. Analytics 

And if you don't have enough demands already, you'd also like to give those experts to see how their videos are doing: do people find them too long? Are they dropping off halfway through? Or are they pausing and rewinding a lot because the video is too quick-paced? How many times are they watching and at what hours do they prefer to watch? You want all this data to be available in a coherent UI or dashboard that'll make it easy to your experts to gain insights on how successful they are. Especially if this is their business. You, as the admin, would also want to see things in higher-level, and see higher-level reports.

## 8. Monetize 
Many product such as this one, reach a point where they want to start earning some $$$ of their useres. For that you would need to know the 'ad-tech'. You might chose to use a quick impelementation of some banners, or you might set a sophisticated video campaigns that earns more, but harder to manage. Either ways, thats another integration that you need to learn.  

## 9. Security 

Last but not least, you need to protect user content. You need to make those videos aren't just floating around the internet, available for anyone to see. You need to make sure that paid content is only viewable to those who have paid for it. You need to make sure that only those approved by the experts can edit or delete content. Enter the whole world of permissions and privileges, oftentimes too complicated to even wrap your head around. 

## 10. Hosting

## 11. Playback

And so now adding video capabilities to your recipe sharing platform is seeming like a bigger headache than it's worth. Nobody needs video anyway, right?
Wrong. 
When done right, video can enhance your platform and take it to a whole other platform. When done right, video can be engaging, fun, and highly profitable. 

It's a lot of steps and a lot going on, but here's the good news: there is a real live service, that exists, that will handle every single step mentioned above. One service, one platform, one API - call it what you may.
